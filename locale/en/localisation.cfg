[mod-setting-description]
stock-me-up-section-name-setting=Name of the special stock section created by the mod.\nNote: Changing this while a stock request is ongoing may result in unintended behavior.
stock-me-up-section-ignore-setting=Any logistic section containing the character or word specified here will be ignored by the mod.
stock-me-up-aggressive-stock-checking-setting=If enabled, stock requests will be checked every time request cleanup is checked (once per second by default).\nThis makes the stock section much more responsive, especially when returning to a logistic area after leaving; however, it may have a performance impact in large games or if cleanup is set to check very frequently.
stock-me-up-no-automatic-requests-setting=Disables automatic restocking requests from this mod. Set this if you only want the hotkey functionality.
stock-me-up-request-cleanup-check-rate-setting=How often in ticks to check to remove requests from the special stock section (default=60).\nVery low values may impact performance, especially in combination with the aggressive stock checking option.
